# Trafiklab GTFS Examples in PHP

Here you can find scripts written in PHP, as an example on how you can use GTFS, and what's possible with it. All scripts are invoked from the commandline and take 1 parameter, the path to a zipped PHP file.

These examples make use of the Trafiklab GTFS SDK, which can be found at https://github.com/trafiklab/gtfs-php-sdk.
